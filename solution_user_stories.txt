Title: Borrow and return books.

As a librarian,
I want to record when books are borrowed or returned,
so that I can track books.

Scenario 1: Books borrowed should be removed from the book list.
Given that I have a book list with 5 books,
when two books is borrowed,
then I should have a book list with 3 books.

Scenario 2: Books returned should be added to the book list.
Given that I have a book list with 5 books,
when a book is returned,
then I should have a book list with 6 books.
